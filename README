Purpose:

	Fetch, prune, and fast-forward any number of tracking branches over any
	number of remotes at once.  You need not switch branches, and it is safe
	to use even if when your index or tree happen to be dirty.  Useful to
	integrators and others who must follow many shared branches.

Description:

	Think of `git forward` as a tool for providing a branch report very much
	like `git branch -v` ... that also brings branches up-to-date (at least
	where it was trivial to do so).

	It provides full Perl-style regular expression matching against refnames
	in your repo.  E.g., to see topic branches

	Considers the provided local branches, or else all local branches.
	For any remote referenced by those branches, fetch and then prune as
	required by the supplied options.  By default: --fetch --no-prune.

	Unless this is just a --dry-run, any of the considered branches that are
	strictly behind (contained by) their tracked branch are fast-forwarded
	to the tracked tip.  Uncommitted changes are protected---they count as
	being 'ahead' of the tracked branch.

Usage:

	git forward [options] [<name|pattern>...]

Options:

	-h | --help	you're soaking in it! (hint: try -v -h)
	--version
	--license


	# What to work on.  Defaults to config, or else: refs/heads/
	<name>		the named ref, if git finds an exact match, or else <name>
			is treated as a (Perl-style) regexp, and matched against
			names in refs/heads/
	-r		...also match against names in refs/heads/remotes/
	-a		...match against any valid ref (implies -r)


	# What work to do.
	#   if --dry-run, defaults to: --no-fetch --no-prune --no-update
	#   otherwise, defaults to config, or else: --fetch --update --no-prune
	-n | --dry-run
	-f | --fetch | --no-fetch	fetch referenced remotes
	-p | --prune | --no-prune	prune referenced remotes
	-u | --update | --no-update	fast-forward branches if possible


	# How to report.  Default: --no-verbose
	-v | --verbose | --no-verbose
	--color	| --no-color		color (or not) printed refs
